I am home to thompson and I have to live in the time workers party I wear my way ways to get the most out com last night and he stinks ride a horse with technology journalist commentator hi where are you android aries so my background technologist currys open and close hyde park 23rd
okay that's a great interest feel so uh I'm sure you'll have something interesting to say to the face question is on a new technology uh say hello what pay per view we looking to tell a commission which is the hots for emerging technologies which should be invested in Indonesia medium to big data given a horizon 2020 is coming up soon this is not what you need influence Wed the meetings of you rise of spent the past xvery is research programs so um they could be wrong to see the technology what you think is important so they could be a center technologies what you think of a good deeds the ones that should be able to will require and surgery in basement
will be skipped out so I've seen for too many will be skipped out so I've seen for too many phenomena emerge in computing industry and come inside p a ham and some point some flowers labelled like a fourth generation languages remember them animal call systems and pop pop I'd like a fourth generation languages remember them animal call systems and papas proms I have quiz the current approach civic centre is the heinz baked beans there is a How to get out of a fight with a lot of changes going home but taking a step in box like in a few more historical perspective he doesn't seem to be your a complete paris the doesn't get something to me convincing argument at the world so much is the cost of pressure so much is a movie evolution development of very small round networks around the ways we store and 12 of them high speed network around some data processing call maine more sceptical the most people about this computing science fundamentals of the king and if you go to the pub to me the work area oracle again if they just continue whole foods 1340 everything
Okay so ugly 30 points the tele in one you sent that a long is a little Robin in which area we spend money on uh so you seem able to come in on um do you think it's with investment or is it any the city has any subset anybody Killa subaerial was labeled a TESE way you think of you think that's too much money being spent over the moment the other is in my interviews I've heard from several people that what they see it happening is they see a collection of technologies uh widget East Hyde something commensal improvement uh and this collection of technologies when they come together to provide something that seems to be very new search for example the umm neither is he to you now do you information extraction of weight scale which lives on information extraction to improving but also other frame which coming into play such as easy to use such as to do so the two coming Sat 18 uh it is there anything we should be metal should be to the Commission stop funding this area uh and then secondly uh it is it anything in this incremental improvements of collections of technologies now for using something which which is somehow difference
Am I think saint john tulsa first question their auditions been raised and there are fundamental to old is being developed which will merrick from investment in the way your mum do you have a chance to do in a station lg for many years have more or less test self I love you you're amazing is that we don't need to spend some money to ensure that things develop in a way which supports the broad restorations on your community academy nesbitt social and economic home simply because as I said there are improvements insert key technologies around waste stored process data around the scenes of the week extract from it around the way to deploy did the core technology for the room mate how are we made better and if you look at your database example am weekends in a row 3 bottles start to stream data phone catherine sale goto earth house of the big research project what happened cindy alex is so cool stuff to look very carefully at the ways in which state so there are real tech solutions hunter constellation 1 berry some attention cause solving candied pecans listen to youtube ways to think about solving some social club texas so might get more about 37 to be your friend and that's odd because I don't think things change I don't think there is a junction between the way you still awake now great enough for us to sing well it's a whole new world I did everything post office and spa to come to u haul increase system digital to 2 ways in which we are facing science is social science politics education everyday life in some areas around the things that are not owned by the databases and database systems to increase the lines of wight society wife call on teaching tools technology create a mission the decision to label want to kill  photos the big day trip I feel more confusing than in like a particular use to smuggle in another collection of texas at it approaches to problem solving the puzzle benefits so what is interested is halloween a look at these texas is a sauce and spencers vestment with things like very high speed networks contact data stores houses in particular and hound That gives access to the Internet how to cation to make phone calls to the station spain scored by pharmacy phone companies have an idea behind this phone is fairly easily accessible britains should give a sports we have instruments are in 4 months throwing around devices like this and looking at it the dictator thing to do in la how improve quality data capture how cold storage in ounces I hate having proved bility to make inferences from it and so to little about what this means for the wine society so what that is the question yes it's worth spending money on it but I think that we should be spending money in it and be quiet sceptical about that big a picture mode I'm willing to start at this is just a passing is very important societal questions about what will happen
Okay uh that's very interesting so close is the one point you know as well as me leaving back to the uh one's ability to attract large amounts of funding from the UN from national governments send to depend on having lice label and so you have a chicken and egg without that you create a label label you know that attract the funding so that you can do something interesting rather than the other way around sometimes um but after that somehow life uh I have to again to follow up questions what is on what you talk about the 10 logical side and the side so so you mentioning that we have to be at this point of money this about to be obligated to what's labeled is big data and you will see if a message to aage you about how they might give ya is this money uh it and if you move it to be used with any specific areas may have mentioned already such as I speak necklace that you would say OK to these are a couple of to kill a specific areas maybe you should put the money uh maybe other areas but you you might want to say these are some areas with you really shouldn't spend the money on nnnn sorry it said a lot is on you mentioned the social sciences so you did you think I should be specific allocation of funds right I guess you do the social a resume be able to say little bit more about how those funds should be spent so tell me about the the the founding here so then let's spend the money in the second largest lace a little send money in hand in the social side so good areas all elements of the social side with you think okay let me let that stop f****** need it and I guess maybe from what you signed the social the Social Fund it will be coupled with the title of you finding same ol BS a separate seem to like go together that is clear bill

Well thanks a lot built a couple things you said that which uh resin night with other interviewees uh the iPad uh I think they're it to come out one is um the ECU vs the US so um I was speaking to you I'll Drive stories founder of Samanta and he was saying that the US has early in the Big Data area but she will maintain because of the difference between the US and EU privacy laws that there is in Harris tension between open data and proceed uh the one cause we fully resolved so you have to choose whether you want one or the other so I guess he was on vacation in the US model in the EVE a little somehow holding us back this is also mention by mission Benjamins uh who's a in a vice president at Telefonica nade was complaining that um he wishes the he could do the things it is mobile data the IT companies can do with that data so he was he was like a p**** you to allow company like to do more of that I bought they say they want to sell mobile data to allow me to help companies to plan with the shops of them issues which is this um uh this is the tradeoff between pregnancy uh and open this and the difference between US and EU stand any of your not fat um go over to my second point cinema
I think im engine stopped open data and proceed open data doesn't apply and personal data halifax call open data principles is pretty good so I think you need to turn not not supposed to eat fish for sale in addition interesting to see real and lube tube no translation and are doing incredibly good portion working in navigate that distinction choose a difference between the sense that personal data peebles to the organisation connects it and sends remains some of the most person who contributed and organisations in u k your like my data on my t*** peppers data stored be used at ucla college park pensions and are trying to construct and services based around perspective individual and potato bake a joke about this is a flexible isa can beat me to the veil so beautiful little want to use mobile data have to pull a massive attack 25 pound shop swap why does a good customers and say no to be with your mobile taste the service and we will take 5 percent of your phone bill every month results problem solved I'm here companies can just not want to go to the top of consent for the day 2010 post update map of hotel in northampton uk autozone animal friends with that would be awesome if your apps respect for individuals and ever seen some have a massive am in home inhibitor to elgin crescent listen why do u s a c moore in houston texas that could be looking at things to do with your soul sisters banking and promotion listen to blame the fact that we have american system would stop companies albert road using my personal data for them for their profit and if so I don't think anything of it if u s nero is much paper and pen is in a bit of a smoke screen companies just walked over to
Ok a semicircle point was on um I get to see my mom is this the EU can fill in the gaps of the addressing the needs of the EU citizens which we will not be addressed by the large companies in the area and I'll save it to the fact that the education is important otherwise we'll end up with my solat Michael because of Microsoft Office in schools anymore so um this I think he likes to uh uh to interview like it when is the balance of the cold is it in Hawaii who is it cause in the first fully the shooting and he said that and he thought it was important that communities engaged and one way to do this is the communities should be involved in acquiring data so he told by zombies well as citizens with collecting radiation data off to the three shemales is all stuff and also collecting a quality guys Wednesday so then citizens should be educated the day should be involved in the process very beginning and then they can engage in the debates and meaningful level which um uh uh how's the from Google who is on the people living on Google Fusion Tables which allows any citizen see you have the data stored by Google uh this public data is being used to detect by faith to Jon lists so they probably collecting data can be used by Jen list of interesting stories uh so um I guess my phone is coming on this um the Disney so it is UK in uh daze need for the EU to us from the Aries baby face my face and is this it did you think of this community engagement is possible so sweetie you spending areas to get to keep the uses to be involved in the day to all levels
