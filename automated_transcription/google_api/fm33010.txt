Okay I believe its so dumb semi final question is really AM the message question so um I like my colleagues in the big projects of interviewing other people um I'm looking other resources to great I love mode maps and white papers so um either now or Sun maybe later bye emailMy name is Montauk I am trained in Dark Sector and have worked a lot with interactive environments of the year I over the years I founded a platform a generalized ate a broker for the other things I noticed at spade.com uh we were acquired by the US company log me in in 2011 reloj does colin.com way right now head up the ribbon projects um and so I'm involved into the city scale a project to do with data and the sensors and Internet of Things a technician
Okay and thanks for the introduction um so um the fifth person is all the football teams use me about the technology well Teknologies would you think on you umm I'll remove G on the wrinkles in the gonna have a New Orleans in the nearest a median to so this is
I won't talk specifically about technology but I will talk about a pic to take your approach um now this stems from my the interest in the idea that big data does not necessarily contained within its the truth for the capital T um and also my interest in this idea that ah technology is not necessary there to help us see better or see this truth better but that it's there to help us see things differently have different perspectives and the things that I'm interested in that I think is coming now and coming soon is um the focus on citizen participation in the generating of these big data sets um and I refer to this specifically because I think that often there is this feeling especially in Smart City initiatives um that or we need is to have more data and then the appropriate analytical tools with which to assess that data and will then be able to make perfect decisions about how the city should function how the infrastructure should be managed on Andy's will promise on the idea of the city as a sieve something unnecessary needs to be efficient no I'm not only is efficiency not a key driver of what makes City sustainable sustainable and I need to open a kind of a tie a tie the kind of mechanical senses are the cultural sense um but also I hide a tight end be skeptical of this idea that um I'm skeptical of the paradigm in which its stated that data and never looked into that leads to information which inevitably needs to knowledge and so forth on to wisdom um what I think is actually much more important especially again in terms of the smart city in having people involved in this going to process is the idea of taking measurements in other words actually involving people in the process of creating that data um and to that and the point is that in order really to pack a lot of the challenges that are facing is especially with a sec to things like climate change at the moment citizens are in a position where they are they're essentially the position of having two to 2 so the rest there their face either some politician in a scientist in a media figure maybe a religious figure and they have to be at the gate at the cake there their decision-making if you like to someone else um or that the cake that decision to a visualization work Gras 4 or whatever that somebody else or even analysis that somebody else has undertaken any scientist will tell you that the process of capturing data itself uh is extremely important part of the abyss and how you set up the experiment how you create a hypothesis um is all the integral to the that the process of conducting any kind of data capturing experiment and to that end for people that means citizens it I'm talking bout to get involved in the process of measuring actually actually neighbors into question the standards of evidence better than offer to the true otherwise um to Nana's data sets of my particular interest in the kind of technology that I am looking for the ones that actually enable people to be part of the process of capturing the big data and therefore the tools and technologies that I'm looking for that I think are are on the horizon are those actually deal with heterogeneous data sets nope not
K that was extremely interesting let me see if I understand you correctly you proposing on the paradigm shift this if you focus on supposing citizens in being it heading Bowl in the capture of data they can be involved in a fundamentally different wife in How um in how big data is used and how it interprets it because the um long as you get out analyzing Bayside depends on how you set up the initial questions and capture it online citizen to be involved in the early stages that process um I guess the movie involves and know that has could be tonight Milan in other people's interpretations of the fundamental questions and issues of does the big data analysis I'm not trying to upset you getting the it is an element is a shin of big data the big data capturing catches tight
Yeah that's right and you know this this really stands from both the kind of philosophical argument that I kind of alluded to their which is my general skepticism in the idea that there simply is a single objective truth that's all important um and necessary for a set of an efficient city of pregnant idk one which is that the problems we face our complex enough that we need everyone in one way or another to be involved in it in the solution and in confinding that solution what section to find what the problems are and also that you know having having been part of the Internet of Things industry for several years now I just know how to get to the pregnant thing how complex and difficult it is to develop even the data standard that would enable a kind of how much is this data set for all the different data plan on that one might want to I deal with especially in the Smart City on a few if you want to look at a very simple environmental um a number you wanted to measure which is sound level there are so many different products for measuring sound level that measures in very different ways the batt bdbc that my 2p Chris's are mass ah that will probably commercially distinguish themselves by calculating sound level in slightly different ways that the idea if you can just for that single phenomenon coming up with a standard and accepted by everyone uh data format um is going to necessarily be a list of goals so once you find include the the map of the data from all the other phone on and I think it fit it's a fool's gold trying to imagine that we're going to ever have a how much is a status at the table s2 on second really crucial probably a crucial issues about uh of the 21st century about our cities in our environment in our relationship to natural systems the test for such a relief it is only the pregnant thing as well to say that well it was going to have to deal with Heather Jin 88 and select build at in from the beginning rather than trying to hack something at the end
Okay question is um you I know you've come this is a text and let it may be there a way you could expand on this just in case I miss anything so I'm wondering what changes sorry if they catch a ring this um and use a citizen data um we have a genius see um that you mention I'm so we need to do with that you mentioned before then maybe um they said they'll be clean and maybe love holding the data so you could use a little love changes what is the main characteristic is isometric and then falling on the other in Utah and some tools the we need to deal with this type of data that you're most interested in
Um so I'm drawing on a couple of pasta experiences here I want to which is on going on the first is looking at the at the way that the patch bay community and touch me being our platform the the way to the community umm we'll work with radiation data in the weeks and months following the nuclear crisis in Japan uh a couple of years ago now what's love what became very clear in the in hours and days of the the the the doctor for a shemagh was that not enough information is being released by the local governments and off in a format that wasn't very useful to people who are really concerned about what's happening on a sauna on a permanent basis and so we found the community rallying around creating examples of how to connect a particular radiation-sensitive the internet upload it to Pat face too I'm 22 just a scrape other life monitors to send that data to the system and basically to build up this kind of data repository of real time data that resulted in I'm a thinker with a couple of weeks of ther p.m. to the doctor uh 700 not a couple of thousand the day to feed the radiation cross the country now out what was important about this was um that it in Naples people at the first stage just a measure something that was important to them but in terms of a set of data science look at the data set it was very message of course because people using a different um a radiation monitor they were using different units micro secrets not a grey um they were in some cases positioning the devices prepping correctly um uh pointing down rather than up or to the side or or or what have you um and so the data was in many senses a kind of a messy dataset and headed to definitely not too much much nicer but was interesting was that by virtue of being a public data set and being publicly created in real time there was a lot of conversations around that data that said back into the data creation process so they were people with the domain specific knowledge of radiation were able to look at individual feeds and say you know that looks as though it's been tied to the wrong units or are you sure you got that uh that device pointing in the right direction because it looks as though it might not be um uh and so on and so forth is it so that what you had was a kind of the Billy 22 Locust crowdsource the creation of the day to crowdsource the the BBM revaluation of the day that you see them in a minute so I think that's 11 kind of important mechanism that's needed is some way for the community especially those with the main specific knowledge about different areas because of course people who are um good at or understand things like um radiation data may not necessarily be the same people were really good at building electronics for connecting to the internet let's say um but the capacity for them all to talk in the same place in provide that says ive second-order feedback on the day to crash in South I think is important thing I'm the second example I'm going to refer to is the air quality egg community which is a community um founded in person as them and then an increasing in the United States of people who are concerned about their quality and two then um had a Kickstarter campaign to create a citizen glad they're calling at work now in
Okay that sounds very very interesting sorry um AFI recap so you need envelopes from the umm you can us in Japan and the equity community umm you really just grinding a.m. community driven approach 2886 CAPTCHA um is on the way in an office and communities is very very important because uh then maybe deficiencies in the way to the dangers catch it because it at invited music after the community somehow get over this but he just ran since I have with a different roles on and the VPN on Tuesday thanks Bill to code with neem catch a fish in she's a sweetie in paradigm is the community catches and um implement Susan the hostess in to the city today to the capturing present question two other person around 930 just let me know if that's correct and also um what do the kids music is it any relationship do the grassroots can use the SS and the public sex a so wet down there very often serve releasing data of theirs phone um and if you think that then maybe that should be any so what was on my feet so just let me know if you got it Miami have the correct and its relationship between is crossroads at Fitz and the in public sector strike the calendar
Soviet does that was a good to a summary of the point I was trying to make a man with respect to the relationship to the public sector up what do you think that said is that um as much as I'm interested in this idea of making data public um of course what I'm really interested in is the public making the data that says suppose the best the point I was making it in in response to the previous two questions so in terms of on the relationship to the public sector I said I'm looking for those kinda frameworks that really enable people to be part of that process no there is definitely still a role for the public sector in for example making data public but I suppose what I would look for in in that case is ways for people to invite you know when a vapor for the people I'm talking about just general citizens some how to make hypotheses if you like around the data and to try in if you like to do something two to 2 action something based on that date so that it doesn't just fall back into kind of data spectatorship of a map or a beautiful visualization of you say to me because I think that the case of air quality on off in there is a set of a local government might could use a map of the air quality of the city of which is certain names um but in terms of an individual citizens who could change with a live um just knowing that their street has better quality is not necessarily a useful bit of information um but on the other hand in a titty to get something I think is it really interesting example um there was an initiative I believe it was created by staining in the US uh to create maps for crimes spotting and rather than just leaving it at that another is just a map of where crimes occur in your neighborhood what people started doing was they would print out the map and they would take it to the local police station and say you know what are you going to do about that so I know what can we actually do with the stated we have to think that was the important step it wasn't just making the map it was when citizens are able to use that to going to basically hold someone accountable for us and hopefully uh to generate some kind of change and soak in any kind of public sector release of the data I'm looking for much more than just pack of the palms or just making the dataset available online I'm looking for those tools that actually enable people to 22 to change their mind about something or make a decision or or have some kind of hypothesis that that the contest against it
Um its all my wishes came true yes that's a question on a machine refer to something that actually has happened I'm going to give example of the City of Boston I like a lot of other cities they created a mobile app for people to file complaints about things that were on problematic in the same things like graffiti your rubbish or or what have you um this is a fairly common thing now I'm too for city to launch an app for people to to make a complaint um add to my mind simply leaving it at that is not sufficient because it doesn't that itself setup a kind of relationship between the Citizen the local government that I think is not necessarily one that wants to encourage where effectively you know uh uh uh a citizen of the plaintiff two to 2 230 and some place to live The Sims out he's going to complain but what the city Boston did which is very interesting was that they made that Davis at public the dataset to do with the complaints and we'll be found was um that sells started taking action on the things that they saw in that that data so um they didn't have to wait for somebody else to come in clear up brother shirt clean up the graffiti I in some cases neighbors would actually get together trying to resolve something together once there was this kind of obvious public data repository deliver than the fact that other people were concerned about it as well so this is what I find um uh hardening if you like that that there are these kind of processes that bring people together around the city of big data sets that actually fosters greater engagement with them perhaps even responsibility for um hi there been in barmen is a hole because I think that if I have to become a little bit to use to the idea that the city is simply something apart from us that we happen to inhabit as opposed to be something to wear actually part of and a generating in recreating if you like everyday on and off for something that we citizens have an affect on and said so too to whatever extent as possible for for that so the data generation plus making public um but you know what whatever except it's possible for that 22 actually to a feeling that
Okay I believe its so dumb semi final question is really AM the message question so um I like my colleagues in the big projects of interviewing other people um I'm looking other resources to great I love mode maps and white papers so um either now or Sun maybe later bye email
Hi to people spring to mind on what is then hell I'm not sure if you're speaking to him but he is the CEO of fabric a um has also works at Sarah and Friday other places that he talks a lot about the relationship of things like that and also um create an axe in the context of public sector he would be one um nothing to German Django the umm the artist engineer hi who's worked a lot with data and indicators um not especially within the context of the urban environment I would be somebody else on both of whom I cannot make an introduction that's useful um and how one other person I would be on Adam Greenfield author of everywhere umm the doing a job so you did Chris computing a thing cause the subtitle um who would also have the things to say on this send it again I can I introduce you as usual
Okay maybe if um um I do a quick check and then and I'm off new nothing to do that um so that's the end of the interview I think I'd like to thank you a lot for the time you said your valuable time getting up food for us and the same ones of you to know that to the business stuff and then I'm off email it to Mike Lee from the slope and I'll let you know me to see it so thanks a lot and your time very very much appreciated my pleasure I had to
Okay thank you have a good night
Okay thank you have a good afternoon
