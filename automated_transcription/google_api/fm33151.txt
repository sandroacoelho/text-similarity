um okay so gah I need the a structured data research team at Google um I have a the passage to be a professor of the computer science is your Washington where I started the database group um I've been working on the integration with data for a couple of decades now um my interest rate now as it pertains to big data is not this early uh the big date in terms of individual data set sizes but its more in terms of the number of data sets that can come together to umm to provide some insight in particular what I'm interested in what is the best number of interesting data sources that exist on the web you're just sitting there or behind of forms or locked up in organizations which can be put on the way more about the number of interesting day off thats umm that makes the problem uh that I'm interested in
Okay hello search um I'm wondering if you could outline what you think of this new for removing technology technology the we should be aware of sorry if you think that's where I live in the White Paper the density ravine Commission and direction of funding programs it's not cheating if you to influence so what would you say Jesus the we should be looking at any need a medium to the guys to have a big impact in the data space
um okay uh I think they're there a few technologies that are um I would say their new but they did their application for the day the skillet wish they need to work is new so this is having to do with a to touch in 80 so you're getting a lot of data from many independent sources and you need to get together and get some insights you need to be able to reconcile their beer meeting so this means that you need to met too um uh reconcile entities definition of entities in different data sources need to know when to refer to the same entity you need to understand schematic differences run to logical differences between a different data for speech problems have been around forever but now you're dealing with the scale of magnitude more data sources uh then before the other thing that pops up will make a big difference here is a Duke the ability to extract a high-quality data from the web um is I think it is has changed uh a very profound wat kind of things that we can do so today you can go and find uh couples if you like it or triples instead of a have many ints already so maybe in terms of the the email they're not as rich as soon as you know something like that to be a turn for the number of entities that that exist Indian holidays they already crossed the threshold of being of having um enough critical mass I did you can you can use them as a place where you can talk to you in a different datasets together um even if it is even if not every into the new data set is included in these things of the final thing I will mention here is also did the opportunity to talk about with crossword so there's no today I think um nobody expected to do all the work for you when you put all these data sources together I think the opportunities to use uh the crowd Mechanical Turk I think this area just a starting to emerge ah right now so that the pic please get all these things up I think prison is very exciting time zones of large-scale data
sign hello search um I'm interested in Exton what's normal about these technologies and I think you covered some of this let me just check so you're saying does acetyl technologies uh reconciling entities um align the schematic differences um extracting hycosy information from the web um very long geez umm the best vision pedia and for those you send some of those been around for awhile what's different now is Kyle and then you a little about crossword for using human uh um what so problems so he is normal maybe is the the challenge the face now um and Sons scales what is anything else that we should mention send another
um yes I think uh yeah that I think you just right about that I think the I think its the fact that some of these technologies are coming together at the same time so now we have a we have the sergeant ology we have a beginning of open Information section which means that now you can you can start taking the extra stuff on the web compare it to what a really good thing in a large mouth bass and start having a virgin where you you're getting better and better and better you think thats a ugly is the mature now is the ability to do uh uh parking uh uh Avensis I would like to finish packing now you can actually imagine having a Nokia n8 parts for everything from the web which means you can start again to find the roles of different a token to send you can do better in ounces
is a is making us a step we're making a step in terms of a of snow building on that for open relationship having a gold set off of the data to the bootstrap off and we have any data sets of the weekend um we can go then so we have millions of excellent a small data sets on the web sitting there in an HDMI cable we didn't have that before now world for able to uh find good ones from the bad ones uh much more reliable than we have in the past that is one of the things I would mention is um uh we have a lot of data but I think I will need to ask about who cares about it okay so we think we need to be very guarded by what is the date of the taxi of interested people which means that we need to make a date available to people who who could care about it and do stuff with it so I'll just take a gamble off of the one of the things that we do here Google um we let people at a new data and find a to the Texas but fundamentally were a world-leading uh people do something to sing with the wrong with their own data with other data alert and it is the need that is driving duh um the
okay uh and the school search um he stated is the collection of these technologies that have the Hyatt in back together and they might do separately in a slice in G uh between HIV and you got lined umm the full sons of having a I'm interested parties so if a committed use a community can do something interesting the day to day life push how ya um how useful is the and the quality search um uh let my next question a time to do with the benefits and capabilities the technology keyboard covers fit somehow the families together umm when you to move from unstructured data is Kyle The end in C pas is the whole web based on this connection say um if you could say um if a possum what you said is any benefit to that comes out of the office is that what is the skate limits of these technologies so um what would they be good full and Wednesday maybe not be as good for please yeah
uh I think in terms of the benefits umm the the nice thing about the extraction from the web is that the weather is about everything so you have a very very broad coverage in terms of your uh your domain so you can people write about any topic they want on the web uh because they care about um and so the best thing that makes that um also interesting is that end in database systems are in 30 we use to the starting from pit lane before we start navigation to deal with no this aspect of Medicine root words email about uh I'm on the way we don't have that uh uh we can do that to the web about everything for the whole idea conceptualizing your domain um changes the benefit because you get a lot of rest of what you doing umm the challenge uh oh is that if you want to go deeper in a particular uh domain of how do you do that suppose you know your web but then you're working at the killer tomatoes biology um and you have an apology for that
okay very very interesting and Grace a visa sounds having breasts and at the same time um what is the others collection of souls with son considering you're considering on other many design principles come out search it United
on fight them after you're finished uh your question you got cut off there but I'll take it as it is um Flint into a note two things one is you you mentioned the um going between on structured instructor data I think for certain things unstructured data is good so I don't think we should be thinking about you all the time in terms of of only structure data we should be thinking of entering the information needed people might have some of them on documents then we should understand the structure of the document document gives us a silly have to understand all the details of the document giving us in the a in a structured fashion I think there's a um we should go all the structured all the way I wanna sing I would say is that we need to think of the multilingual uh basketball this week Does that mean in English but um its it's interesting consider you a bunch of you from the very beginning how everything that you're doing uh skills two different languages in different languages give you a different perspective uh mean you wouldn't want to learn about Japanese culture art uh English doesn't make sense you're going to be able to get much more depth about a particular topic if you go to the a to the language uh they're created I'm so that's one thing to get my
okay does 222 bacon for Sun considered unstructured data instructions to get to the goal is just to move to a structure fisheye I guess the under the MIT and what's in the fridge will see when does a new European send them to consider voting by the sea from the very beginning um uh uh I'll put together um and they all the time what is a performance metrics the one has to consider so if I'm going shopping now for a commercial visions of the tools what forms Netflix when I look at you measure which the best to the other end in the second one is willing to trade offs so when you're designing and building systems what is the trade-offs one
uh uh if you get caught up there again but umm the engine does the finishing touches so um in terms of performance uh you want it depends on what what part of your system you're talking about some of them you talking about this the part of the system that is the interacting with user not necessarily the departed doing all the pipelines of analysis in and uh uh uh uh uh do I find those big is long as they need longer good um so that the trade-off there is no for the trade off is try to do as much advance as possible um uh for the response on candy candy really good time Google you have a facebook fast then people don't care no matter how good it is of people don't don't don't don't have patience so in terms of response times you want to uh uh
uh uh if you get caught up there again but umm the interns of the financial position so um in terms of performance uh you want it depends on what what part of your system talking about this the part of the system that is the interacting with user not necessarily does the party you need to uh you need to do whatever smarty you you can in order to uh have facebook status means of putting stuff on flash memory uh on getting a great day text pictures ugh F in with the user might want a like that in terms of the interfaces you also want to make sure that you want to test your your user interface is all the time so you want to make sure the people find an intuitive 11 thing W often suffer from is having user interfaces that are too uh uh too busy people can actually find uh what they need people have very limited attention you want to make sure they get their answer the questions you want to be able to anticipate a question so for example a search engines give you autocomplete for queries you couldn't you can try you can imagine generalizing that to a to start your day to you have to because you can't assume that people will know uh email You need to be able to uh a jetski a wave asking questions that you can a you can interpret I don't know that you have anything going shopping for for systems right now I don't uh I don't know that you have the much does election of the what to buy a pic you these things are alright get to be a to be built
Okay uh that's interesting sorry um Louisville to be f*** f*** search engines and wanted to the Facebook one uses it to do as much as you can before the end of the school so um
um you know the dude if there was a way of taking a natural language question in translating it into um some form of structured query that could be answered from a database when the answer is there that would be that that's what I know that's what I would love some but that's the old people are working on that end in berries form I think maybe maybe 15 is um you know how are working for today to Google okay but you know that already off of the of Grey read on Google and Apple stock today so I need to think of myself as blending into uh the best bestest that is that is what people uh care about food taken in and uh uh I think the thing to keep in mind its what what is the user trying to achieve okay
Do the drop off so the question is where is it that the technology that that we are building can fit in uh to help the user need to be date we need to look at what what is the what is the perspective of the tax form from the user's point of you and see where it is that it can fit in it might not be front and center the wait uh you know we are committed to be so look at the end of the because you're going to be dealing with many different kinds of of users have a mini 25 principal where is it that are the ology can help and make sure that you fit right in there to wait for the user is that that's where the Windsor going to be
I think that I think that can be huge umm I'll give you an example of the use of whatever what are the Droid mostly in in our own work on kitchen table Google Google well that comes out of my team uh we were the our goal is to make database is easy to use um which would have been something that people have had talked about for a while and most gratifying set of users that we've had over the last few years are jealous jealous update they try to tell a story a pain in the story they are they want to date a story to back it up to make it more interesting one to active and I think about this is they have a mini pies coming to their site they are the place where we're in for mission gets a huge fan up so um and then they working in any kind of domain so uh to me that's what are the example of if you enable the people who have the data and have the add to bring dated the beer then you you're making a huge impact for this The Weeknd schedule is from all over the world dealing with friends into sticks uh uh you know riots in London uh couple years ago or Oregon uh you know after Crisis Response ovulation people actually looking for um where where where where there is a shelter to uh they can go to vote if you bring data to the right people at the right time of whether it's in times of crisis weather in time of reading a newspaper article weather in time trying to make a decision about 4 um weather to bow to looking at at Trenton and really grounding discussions the political discourse in data the info and then once what's that the company warm because data is this is the end is easy to 855 you to bring David to peer to a problem of the impact is is sick and EDS I can be normal umm the few months ago uh ago when after the a massacre in in the in the school in in Connecticut umm some journalists uh wins and uh and look for the the records of who applied for a gun permit in in two counties in New York State Westchester County in another county this is this the public information okay so there's the Freedom of Information Act ugh know if I live there and I don't have a gun permit for me don't want people uh I need your target for foreverrrr something like that so that and you know it is this this article got this the famous days ago so the ugly ability that does the time you get back is it is starting to the discussion about what data is it should be made public um um imagine starting to put the day together with other days its like you know uh uh a*** sex offenders make that was the fact that you're starting to get into a whole new realm your where data is playing fetch amore uh pretty cool roll and impact uh I need to start site I believe that this is not only live in any domain where your camera what are you doing research or take my my favorite ugh know if I live there and I don't have a gun permit for me don't want people uh I need your target for foreverrrr something like that so that and you know it is this this article got this the famous days ago so the ugly ability that does the time you get back is it is starting to the discussion about what data is it should be made public um um imagine starting to put the day together with other days its like you know uh uh a*** sex offenders make that was the fact that you're starting to get into a whole new realm your where data is playing fetch amore uh pretty cool roll and impact uh I need to start site I believe that this is not only live in any domain where your camera what are you doing research or take my my favorite
okay that's great um bringing the right side to this off today to the black people in the life forms an integrating the various states if you get the basic the changes people's and societies: the section you really crazy menu view uh that uh I suppose decision making and discussion the rebound so um what I was a cup too much of your time search um to finish up I just have a question for you need I'll announce Oloffson via email umm as of a series of interviews the live from the people's opinions you want to take into my wife paper um if there's any individual full for an organizations that you think we should also speak to the Okay um I will probably take that question mostly offline um but uh you're probably thinking ready to regular Krishnan had some experience the Yahoo um up on wifi to Rudy from NYU is the guy who's the worst thing work um is a computer scientist in the Business School in place to be um what of Las Vegas often think about morning
Okay so um thanks for that so in the end of the interview hello so I'm adult enough of you um once it's finished and um um as you're happy I'm about to blow in soonish finally thank you for your time um give me about a time for us thank you very very much is it going to be very very valuable for Allah wallpaper ah thank you very much is worthy for great questions I'm I'm glad you're doing this looking forward to see what would you okay to have a good the rest of the day thank you again
