MY NAME IS USMAN HAQUE I'M TRAINED AS AN ARCHITECT AND HAVE WORKED A LOT WITH INTERACTIVE ENVIRONMENTS OVER THE YEAR I OVER THE YEARS I FOUNDED A PLATFORM GENERALIZE DATA BROKER FOR THE INTERNET OF THINGS KNOWN AS PATCHBAY.COM WE'RE REQUIRED BY THE US COMPANY LOG ME IN IN 2011 WE LAUNCHED AS COSM.COM WE'RE RIGHT NOW HEAD UP THE URBAN PROJECTS AND SO I'M INVOLVED IN SORT OF CITY SCALE PROJECTS TO DO WITH DATA AND SENSORS AND INTERNET OF THINGS TECH INITIATIVES
OKAY THANKS USMAN FOR THE INTRODUCTION SO THE FIRST QUESTION IS OR THE FIRST PART OF THE INTERVIEW IS REALLY ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY OR TECHNOLOGIES WHICH YOU THINK ARE NEW OR EMERGING THAT ARE IMPORTANT THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE AN INFLUENCE IN THE NEAR TO MEDIUM TERM SO THIS IS APPROACHING US TOWARDS THE ? TECHNOLOGIES THAT YOU SHOULD BE INVESTING IN SO IS THERE ANY NEW TECHNOLOGY WHICH YOU COULD DESCRIBE AND SAY WHAT'S NOBLE ABOUT IT WHICH YOU THINK IS IMPORTANT IN NEAR TO MEDIUM TERM
I WON'T TALK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT TECHNOLOGY BUT I WILL TALK ABOUT A PARTICULAR APPROACH NOW THIS STANDS FROM MY INTEREST IN THE IDEA THAT BIG DATA DOES NOT NECESSARILY CONTAIN WITHIN IT THE TRUTH WITH THE CAPITAL T AND ALSO MY INTEREST IN THIS IDEA THAT TECHNOLOGY IS NOT NECESSARILY THERE TO HELP US SEE BETTER OR SEE THIS TRUTH BETTER BUT THAT IT'S THERE TO HELP US SEE THINGS DIFFERENTLY HAVE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES AND SO THE THING THAT I'M INTERESTED IN THAT I THINK IS COMING NOW AND COMING SOON IS THE FOCUS ON CITIZEN PARTICIPATION IN THE GENERATING OF THESE BIG DATA SETS AND I REFERRED TO THIS SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE I THINK THAT OFTEN THERE IS THIS FEELING SPECIALLY IN SMART CITY INITIATIVES THAT ALL WE NEED IS TO HAVE MORE DATA AND THEN THE APPROPRIATE ANALYTICAL TOOLS WITH WHICH TO ASSESS THAT DATA AND WE'LL THEN BE ABLE TO MAKE PERFECT DECISIONS ABOUT HOW THE CITY SHOULD FUNCTION HOW THE INFRA STRUCTURES SHOULD BE MANAGED AND THESE WE'RE ? ON THE IDEA OF THE CITY AS A SORT OF SOMETHING THAT NECESSARILY NEEDS TO BE EFFICIENT NOW NOT ONLY IS EFFICIENCY NOT A KEY DRIVER OF WHAT MAKES A CITY SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABLE AND I MEAN THIS BOTH IN A KIND OF A A A A KIND A KIND OF OF MECHANICAL SENSE AS WELL AS A CULTURAL SENSE BUT ALSO I I I TEND TO BE SKEPTICAL OF THIS IDEA THAT I'M SKEPTICAL OF THE PARADIGM IN WHICH ITS DATA THAT DATA IN NEVER LOOK INEVITABLY LEADS TO INFORMATION WHICH INEVITABLY LEADS TO KNOWLEDGE AND SO FORTH ON TO WISDOM WHAT I THINK IS ACTUALLY MUCH MORE IMPORTANT SPECIALLY AGAIN IN TERMS OF THE SMART CITY AND HAVING PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THIS KIND OF PROCESS IS THE IDEA OF TAKING MEASUREMENTS IN OTHER WORDS ACTUALLY INVOLVING PEOPLE IN THE PROCESS OF CREATING THAT DATA AND TO THAT END THE POINT IS THAT IN ORDER REALLY TO TACKLE A LOT OF THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE FACING US SPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO THINGS LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE AT THE MOMENT CITIZENS ARE IN A POSITION WHERE THEY ARE THEY'RE ESSENTIALLY IN A POSITION OF HAVING TO TO TO SORT OF REST THEIR THEIR FAITH EITHER IN SOME POLITICIAN IN A SCIENTIST IN A MEDIA FIGURE OR MAYBE A RELIGIOUS FIGURE AND THEY EFFECTIVELY ABDICATE ABDICATE THEIR THEIR DECISION MAKING IF YOU LIKE TO SOMEONE ELSE OR THEY ABDICATE THAT DECISION TO A VISUALIZATION OR A GRAPH OR WHATEVER THAT SOMEBODY ELSE OR EVEN AN ANALYSIS THAT SOMEBODY ELSE HAS UNDERTAKEN NOW ANY SCIENTIST WILL TELL YOU THAT THE PROCESS OF CAPTURING DATA ITSELF IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT PART OF THE OF THE AND AND HOW YOU SET UP THE EXPERIMENT HOW YOU CREATE A HYPOTHESIS IS ALL INTEGRAL TO THE THE THE THE PROCESS OF OF CONDUCTING ANY KIND OF DATA CAPTURING EXPERIMENT AND TO THAT END FOR PEOPLE THAT MEANS CITIZENS I I I'M TALKING ABOUT TO GET INVOLVED IN THAT PROCESS OF MEASURING ACTUALLY ACTUALLY ENABLES THEM TO QUESTION THE STANDARDS OF EVIDENCE THAT HAVE BEEN OFFERED TO THEM THROUGH OTHERWISE KIND OF ANONYMOUS DATA SETS AND SO MY PARTICULAR INTEREST IN THE KIND OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT I'M LOOKING FOR ARE THE ONES THAT ACTUALLY ENABLE PEOPLE TO BE PART OF THAT PROCESS OF CAPTURING THE BIG DATA AND THEREFORE THE TOOLS AND THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT I'M LOOKING FOR THAT I THINK ARE ARE ON THE ? ARE THOSE THAT ACTUALLY DEAL WITH RATHER GENIUS DATA SETS YOU KNOW NOT NOT THE KIND OF CLEAN DATA SETS THAT WE USED TO HAVE THAT ARE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THE THE SORT OF STATISTICAL PROBLEMS OF ANOMALIES IN THE DATA OUTLIERS THAT ARE ABLE TO SORT OF IN SOME WAY DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT THERE IS DIFFERENT DATA COMING IN FROM DIFFERENT LOCATIONS MEASURED BY DIFFERENT DEVICES BY DIFFERENT PEOPLE WHO MIGHT NOT EVEN HAVE CALIBRATED THEM CORRECTLY SO THAT IS IS THE KIND OF APPROACH THAT THAT I'M LOOKING FOR AND SEEING ? ON THE ON THE ARISING OF THE BIG DATA WORLD
OKAY THAT WAS EXTREMELY INTERESTING USMAN SO LET ME SEE IF I UNDERSTAND YOU CORRECTLY YOU ARE SOMEHOW PROPOSING THE IT CAN ALMOST BE A PARADIGM SHIFT THAT IF YOU FOCUS ON SUPPORTING CITIZENS IN BEING HEAVILY INVOLVED IN THE CAPTURE OF DATA THEY CAN BE INVOLVED IN A FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT WAY IN HOW IN HOW BIG DATA IS USED AND AND HOW IT IS INTERPRETED BECAUSE THE SOMEHOW THE RESULTS AND ANSWERS YOU GET OUT OF ANALYZING BIG DATA DEPENDS ON HOW YOU SET UP THE INITIAL QUESTIONS AND CAPTURE IT AND ? CITIZENS TO BE INVOLVED IN THE EARLY STAGE OF THAT PROCESS GETS THE MORE INVOLVED AND NOT AS COULD BE TODAY RELYING OF OTHER PEOPLES INTERPRETATIONS OF WHAT THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS AND ISSUES ARE THAT THE BIG DATA ANALYSIS IS SOMEHOW TRYING TO ANSWER SO SURE REALLY GETTING THE IT IT'S AN ELEMENT OF DEMOCRATIZATION OF BIG DATA BUT AT THE AT THE BIG DATA CAPTURING CAPTURE STAGE
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT AND YOU KNOW THIS THIS REALLY STANDS FROM BOTH THE KIND OF PHILOSOPHICAL ARGUMENT THAT I KIND OF ELUDED YOU THERE WHICH IS MY GENERAL SKEPTICISM IN THE IDEA THAT THERE SIMPLY IS A SINGLE OBJECTIVE TRUTH THAT'S ALL IMPORTANT AND NECESSARY FOR A SORT OF AN EFFICIENT CITY BUT IT'S ALSO KIND OF PRAGMATICAL ONE WHICH IS THAT THE PROBLEMS WE FACE ARE COMPLEX ENOUGH THAT WE NEED EVERYONE IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER TO BE INVOLVED IN IN IN IN THE SOLUTION AND IN KIND OF FINDING THAT SOLUTION ALSO ACTUALLY IN DEFINING WHAT PROBLEMS ARE AND ALSO THAT YOU KNOW HAVING HAVING BEEN PART OF INTERNET OF THINGS INDUSTRY FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW I JUST KNOW HOW AND AGAIN THIS IS A PRAGMATIC THING HOW COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT IT IS TO DEVELOP EVEN A DATA STANDARD THAT WOULD ENABLE A KIND OF HOMOGENEOUS DATA SET FOR ALL THE DIFFERENT DATA PHENOMENON ONE BY ONE TO A DEAL WITH THIS SPECIALLY IN THE SMART CITY YOU KNOW EVEN IF YOU IF IF YOU WERE TO LOOK AT A VERY SIMPLE ENVIRONMENTAL PHENOMENON THAT YOU WANTED TO MEASURE WHICH IS SOUND LEVEL THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT PRODUCTS FOR MEASURING SOUND LEVEL THAT MEASURE THEM IN VERY DIFFERENT WAYS BBA BBB BBC THAT MIGHT DO PEAK VERSUS AIR MASS THAT WILL PROBABLY COMMERCIALLY DISTINGUISH THEMSELVES BY CALCULATING SOUND LEVEL IN SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAYS THAT THE IDEA EVEN JUST FOR THAT SINGLE PHENOMENON COMING UP WITH A STANDARD AND ACCEPTED BY EVERYONE DATA FORMAT IS GOING TO NECESSARILY BE AN ELUSIVE GOAL SO ONCE YOU TRY TO INCLUDE THE THE MASSES OF DATA FROM ALL THE OTHER PHENOMENON I THINK IT'S IT'S IT'S ALMOST FOOL'S GOAL TRYING TO IMAGINE THAT WE'RE GONNA EVER HAVE A HOMOGENEOUS DATA SET THAT'S GONNA ENABLE US TO ANSWER THE KIND OF REALLY CRUCIAL PRO CRUCIAL ISSUES ABOUT OF THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY ABOUT OUR CITIES AND OUR ENVIRONMENT AND OUR RELATIONSHIP TO NATURAL SYSTEMS ETC ETC AND SO IT'S REALLY JUST IT IT'S ALMOST A PRAGMATIC THING AS WELL TO SAY THAT WELL WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DEAL WITH ? ? AND SO LET'S BUILD THAT IN FROM THE BEGINNING RATHER THAN TRYING TO HACK SOMETHING AT THE END
OKAY SO A FOLLOW UP QUESTION IS YOU I KNOW YOU'VE COVERED THIS TO CERTAIN EXTENT ALREADY BUT MAYBE THERE ARE WAYS YOU COULD EXPAND UPON THIS SO JUST IN CASE YOU HAVE MISSED ANYTHING SO I'M WONDERING WHAT CHANGES SO IF WE'RE CAPTURING THIS END USER CITIZEN DATA WE HAVE ? THAT YOU MENTIONED SO WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THAT YOU MENTIONED BEFORE THAT THERE MAYBE THE DATA MAY NOT BE CLEAN THERE MAY BE LARGE HOLES IN THE DATA SO COULD YOU SAY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT CHANGES WHAT ARE THE MAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF DATA AND THEN FOLLOWING ON ARE THERE NEW TYPES OF TOOLS THAT WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THIS TYPE OF DATA THAT THAT YOU'RE MOST INTERESTED IN
SO AND DRAWING ON A COUPLE OF PAST EXPERIENCES HERE ONE OF WHICH IS ONGOING THE FIRST IS LOOKING AT THE AT THE WAY THE THE PATCHBAY COMMUNITY PATCHBAY BEING OUR PLATFORM THE THE WAY THAT THE COMMUNITY WORK WITH RADIATION DATA IN THE WEEKS AND MONTHS FOLLOWING THE NUCLEAR CRISIS IN JAPAN A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO NOW WHAT'S WHAT BECAME VERY CLEAR IN THESE IN HOURS AND DAYS AFTER THE THE THE THE DISASTER IN FUKUSHIMA WAS THAT NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION WAS BEING RELEASED BY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND OFTEN IN A FORMAT THAT WASN'T VERY USEFUL TO PEOPLE WHO WERE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING ALMOST ON A ON A PERMANENT BASIS AND SO WE FOUND THE COMMUNITY RALLYING AROUND CREATING EXAMPLES FOR HOW TO CONNECT A PARTICULAR RADIATION CENTER TO THE INTERNET AND UPLOAD IT TO PATCHBAY TO TO TO TO TO SCRAPE OTHER LIVE MONITORS TO SEND THAT DATA TO THE SYSTEM AND BASICALLY TO BUILD UP THIS KIND OF DATA REPOSITORY OF REAL TIME DATA THAT RESULTED IN MY THINK WITHIN A COUPLE OF WEEKS AFTER THE AFTER THE DISASTER SEVERAL HUNDRED IF NOT A COUPLE OF THOUSANDS OF DATA FEED OF RADIATION ACROSS THE COUNTRY NOW WHAT WAS IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS WAS THAT IT ENABLED PEOPLE AT THE FIRST STAGE JUST TO MEASURE SOMETHING THAT WAS IMPORTANT TO THEM BUT IN TERMS OF SORT OF A DATA SCIENCE LOOK AT THE DATA SET IT WAS VERY MESSY OF COURSE BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE USING ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT RADIATION MONITORS THEY WERE USING DIFFERENT UNITS MICRO SIEVERTS NANO GRAY THEY WERE IN SOME CASES POSITIONING THE DEVICES PERHAPS INCORRECTLY IN OTHER WORDS POINTING DOWN RATHER THAN UP OR TO THE SIDE OR OR OR WHAT HAVE YOU AND SO THE DATA WAS IN MANY SENSES A KIND OF A MESSY DATA SET AND RATHER AND YOU KNOW DEFINITELY NOT HOMOGENEOUS BUT WHAT WAS INTERESTING WAS THAT BY VIRTUE OF BEING A PUBLIC DATA SET AND BEING PUBLICLY CREATED IN REAL TIME THERE WAS A LOT OF CONVERSATION AROUND THAT DATA THAT FED BACK INTO THE DATA CREATION PROCESS SO THERE WERE PEOPLE WITH THE DOMAIN SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE OF RADIATION WHO WERE ABLE TO LOOK AT INDIVIDUAL FEEDS AND SAY YOU KNOW THAT LOOKS AS THOUGH IT'S BEEN TAGGED WITH THE WRONG UNITS OR YOU KNOW ARE YOU SURE YOU'VE GOT THAT THAT DEVICE POINTING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BECAUSE IT LOOKS AS THOUGH IT MIGHT NOT BE AND SO ON AND SO FORTH SO THAT SO THAT WHAT YOU HAD WAS A A KIND OF AN ABILITY TO TO NOT JUST CROWD SOURCE THE CREATION OF THE DATA BUT CROWD SOURCE THE THE THE THE EVALUATION OF THE DATA IF YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN AND SO I THINK THAT'S ONE ONE KIND OF IMPORTANT MECHANISM THAT'S NEEDED IS SOME WAY FOR THE COMMUNITY SPECIALLY THOSE WITH DOMAIN SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE ABOUT DIFFERENT AREAS BECAUSE OF COURSE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOOD AT OR UNDERSTAND THINGS LIKE RADIATION DATA MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE THE SAME PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY GOOD AT BUILDING THE ELECTRONICS FOR CONNECTING TO THE INTERNET LET'S SAY BUT THE CAPACITY FOR THEM ALL TO TALK IN THE SAME PLACE AND PROVIDE THAT SORT OF SECOND ORDER FEEDBACK ON THE DATA CREATION ITSELF I THINK IS AN IMPORTANT THING THE SECOND EXAMPLE I'M GONNA REFER TO IS THE AIR QUALITY EGG COMMUNITY WHICH IS A COMMUNITY FOUNDED IN FIRST IN AMSTERDAM AND THEN INCREASINGLY IN THE UNITED STATES PEOPLE WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT AIR QUALITY AND TO THEM HAD A QUICK STARTED CAMPAIGN TO CREATE A SORT OF CITY CITIZEN LED AIR QUALITY NETWORK NOW IN THIS CASE ALL THE DEVICES ARE THE SAME THEY ARE MEASURING CO2 AND I THINK NO2 AND A FEW OTHER THINGS BUT IN ORDER TO KEEP THE COSTS VERY LOW FOR THE COMMUNITY THEY ARE BEING SENT OUT UNCALIBRATED NOW THIS HAS RAISED A LOT OF QUESTIONS SPECIALLY AMONG AIR QUALITY EXPERTS YOU KNOW HOW HOW CAN YOU TRUST THE DATA BUT IT'S GIVEN RISE TO AGAIN A KIND OF SECOND ORDER FEEDBACK ON THAT DATA CAPTURE PROCESS OF PEOPLE WITH THE STATISTICAL CAPABILITIES AND THE CAPABILITIES TO WRITE APPLICATIONS TO START BUILDING TOOLS FOR MAKING USE OF THAT DATA NONETHELESS EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT CALIBRATED TO START TO LOOK AT DELTAS AND CHANGES IN AIR QUALITY OVER TIME AND LOOKING AT THAT IS THE IMPORTANT THING WHETHER SOMETHING HAS IMPROVED OR REGRESSED AS THE IMPORTANT ASPECT NOT SIMPLY THE INDIVIDUAL DATA POINT OR IF IT'S A GENERAL TREND IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND SO BUILDING UP THIS KIND OF TOOLS THAT LOOK AT DATA SETS IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY NOT LOOKING AT THE INDIVIDUAL DATA POINTS BUT AS IF YOU LIKE COLLECTIONS OF DATA POINTS I THINK IS IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT ASPECT TO THAT
OKAY THAT THAT WAS VERY VERY INTERESTING SO IF I RECAP SO YOU THINK THE EXAMPLES FROM THE NUCLEAR CRISIS IN JAPAN AND THE AIR QUALITY COMMUNITY YOU'RE REALLY DESCRIBING A COMMUNITY DRIVEN APPROACH TO BIG DATA CAPTURE EVALUATION AND ANALYSIS AND THE COMMUNITY IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT HERE BECAUSE THERE MAY BE DEFICIENCIES IN THE WAY THAT THE DATA IS CAPTURED BECAUSE IT'S IN THE WAY THAT THE COMMUNITY CAPTURE IT BUT THE COMMUNITY SOMEHOW GETS OVER THIS THROUGH THIS ? THAT THEY HAVE WITH THE DIFFERENT ROLLS AND THE THE TOOLS THAT THEY BUILD TO COPE WITH ANY UNCAPTURED DEFICIENCIES SO IT'S REALLY THE PARADIGM IS THAT THE COMMUNITY CAPTURES AND IMPLEMENTS TOOLS AND ECOSYSTEM TO THE SPECIFIC TO THE TO THE CAPTURING PROCESS WHICH WHICH IS QUITE DIFFERENT TO OTHER PROCESSES AROUND AND SO JUST LET ME KNOW IF THAT'S CORRECT AND ALSO ONE THING THAT OCCURS TO ME IS IS THERE ANY RELATIONSHIP TO THESE GRASSROOTS COMMUNITY EFFORTS AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR SO WHERE TOP DOWN WHERE WHERE VARIOUS GOVERNMENTS ARE RELEASING DATA OF VARIOUS FORMS AND IF NOT DO YOU THINK THAT THAT MAYBE THERE SHOULD BE AND IF SO WHAT WHAT THAT MIGHT BE SO SO JUST LET ME KNOW IF THIS RECAP IF ONE OF MY RECAP WAS CORRECT AND THEN THIS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE GRASSROOTS EFFORTS AND THE AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR ? GOVERNMENT
SO YES THAT THAT WAS A GOOD SUMMARY OF THE POINTS I WAS TRYING TO MAKE WITH RESPECT TO THE RELATIONSHIP TO THE PUBLIC SERVICE SECTOR ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE SAID IS THAT AS MUCH AS I'M INTERESTED IN THIS IDEA OF MAKING DATA PUBLIC OF COURSE WHAT I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN THE PUBLIC MAKING THE DATA AND THAT'S I SUPPOSE THE THE POINT I WAS MAKING IN IN IN RESPONSE TO THE PREVIOUS TWO QUESTION SO IN TERMS OF OF THE RELATIONSHIP TO THE PUBLIC SECTOR I SUPPOSE I'M LOOKING FOR THOSE KINDS OF FRAMEWORKS THAT REALLY ENABLE PEOPLE TO BE PART OF THAT PROCESS NOW THERE'S DEFINITELY STILL A ROLE FOR THE PUBLIC SECTOR IN FOR EXAMPLE MAKING DATA PUBLIC BUT I SUPPOSE WHAT I WOULD LOOK FOR IN THAT CASE IS WAYS FOR PEOPLE TO AND BY YOU KNOW WHENEVER I REFER TO PEOPLE I'M TALKING ABOUT JUST GENERAL CITIZENS SOMEHOW TO MAKE HYPOTHESIS IF YOU LIKE AROUND THE DATA AND TO TRY AND IF YOU LIKE DO SOMETHING TO TO TO ACTION SOMETHING BASED ON THAT DATA SO THAT IT DOESN'T JUST FALL BACK INTO A KIND OF DATA SPECTATORSHIP OF A MAP OR A BEAUTIFUL VISUALIZATION IF YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN BECAUSE I THINK THAT YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE IN THE CASE OF AIR QUALITY OFTEN THERE IS A SORT OF A LOCAL GOVERNMENT MIGHT PRODUCE A MAP OF THE AIR QUALITY OF THE CITY WHICH ACHIEVE CERTAIN AIMS BUT IN TERMS OF THE INDIVIDUAL CITIZENS WHO CAN'T CHANGE WHERE THEY LIVE JUST KNOWING THAT THEIR STREET HAS BAD AIR QUALITY IS NOT NECESSARILY A USEFUL BIT OF INFORMATION BUT ON THE OTHER HAND YOU KNOW TO TO TO GIVE SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS A REALLY INTERESTING EXAMPLE THERE WAS AN INITIATIVE I BELIEVE IT WAS CREATED BY STEINMAN IN THE US TO CREATE MAPS FOR CRIME SPOTTING AND RATHER THAN JUST LEAVING IT AT THAT IN OTHER WORDS IT'S JUST A MAP OF WHERE CRIMES HAVE OCCURRED IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD WHAT PEOPLE STARTED DOING WAS THEY WOULD PRINT OUT THE MAP AND THEY WOULD TAKE IT TO THE LOCAL POLICE STATION AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT ARE YOU ACTUALLY GONNA DO ABOUT THIS YOU KNOW WHAT CAN WE ACTUALLY DO WITH THIS DATA THAT WE HAVE AND I THINK THAT WAS THE IMPORTANT STEP IT WASN'T JUST MAKING THE MAP IT WAS WHEN CITIZENS WERE ABLE TO USE THAT TO GO AND YOU KNOW BASICALLY HOLD SOMEONE ACCOUNTABLE FOR IT AND HOPEFULLY YOU KNOW GENERATE SOME KIND OF CHANGE AND SO IN ANY KIND OF PUBLIC SECTOR RELEASE OF THE DATA I AM LOOKING FOR MUCH MORE THAN JUST ? OR JUST MAKING THE DATA SET AVAILABLE ONLINE I'M LOOKING FOR THOSE TOOLS THAT ACTUALLY ENABLE PEOPLE TO TO TO TO TO CHANGE THEIR MINDS WITHOUT SOMETHING OR MAKE A DECISION OR OR HAVE SOME KIND OF HYPOTHESIS THAT THEY CAN THEN TEST AGAINST IT
OKAY THAT THAT THAT WAS VERY INTERESTING SO IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE PROMOTING NEW FORMS OF ENGAGEMENT OF THE CITIZENS THROUGH THIS GRASSROOT COMMUNITY ACQUISITION ANALYSIS AND USE OF BIG DATA AND SO LEAVE ME ON TO THE TO THE LAST PART OF THIS INTERVIEW WHICH IS I'M INTERESTED IN THE IMPACT OR POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THIS WORD SO SO LET'S ASSUME THAT SOMEHOW ALL YOUR WISHES BECOME TRUE IN TERMS OF SUPPORTING CITIZENS IN THE AROUND BIG DATA WHAT DO YOU THINK THE IMPACT OF THIS WILL BE AND YOU CAN TALK ABOUT IMPACT IN TERMS OF ANY COULD BE TECHNICAL SOCIETAL WHICH MAY BE MAY BE MOST INTERESTING ECONOMIC POLICY OR BUSINESS WHAT WHAT WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF THIS ALL SUCCEEDS
IF ALL MY WISHES CAME TRUE YES THAT'S THAT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION I LIKE TO REFER TO SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY HAS HAPPENED AND I'M GONNA GIVE THE EXAMPLE OF THE CITY OF BOSTON LIKE A LOT OF OTHER CITIES THEY CREATED A MOBILE APP FOR PEOPLE TO FILE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THINGS THAT WERE PROBLEMATIC IN THE CITY YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE GRAFFITI OR RUBBISH OR WHAT HAVE YOU AND THIS IS A FAIRLY COMMON THING NOW TO FOR A CITY TO LAUNCH AN APP FOR PEOPLE TO TO MAKE A COMPLAINT TO MY MIND SIMPLY LEAVING IT AT THAT IS NOT SUFFICIENT BECAUSE IT THAT THAT ITSELF SETS UP A KIND OF RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CITIZEN AND THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT I THINK IS NOT NECESSARILY ONE THAT ONE WANTS TO ENCOURAGE WHERE EFFECTIVELY YOU KNOW A A A A CITIZEN IS A PLAINTIVE TO TO TO TO AUTHORITY AND SIMPLY SORT OF SENDS OUT THESE KIND OF COMPLAINTS BUT WHAT THE CITY OF BOSTON DID WHICH WAS VERY INTERESTING IS THAT THEY MADE THE DATA SET PUBLIC THE THE DATA SET TO DO WITH THE COMPLAINTS AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT CITIZENS THEMSELVES STARTED TAKING ACTION ON THE THINGS THAT THEY SAW IN THAT THAT DATA SO THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR SOMEBODY ELSE TO COME AND CLEAR UP RUBBISH OR CLEAN UP THE GRAFFITI IN SOME CASES NEIGHBORS WOULD ACTUALLY GET TOGETHER AND TRY TO RESOLVE SOMETHING TOGETHER ONCE THERE WAS THIS KIND OF OBVIOUS PUBLIC DATA REPOSITORY THAT ALERTED THEM THE FACT THAT OTHER PEOPLE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT IT AS WELL SO THIS IS WHAT I FIND HARDENING IF YOU LIKE THAT THAT THERE ARE THESE KIND OF PROCESSES THAT BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER AROUND THIS SORT OF BIG DATA SETS THAT ACTUALLY FASTERS GREATER ENGAGEMENT WITH AND PERHAPS EVEN RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE URBAN ENVIRONMENT AS A WHOLE BECAUSE I THINK THAT YOU KNOW PERHAPS YOU'VE BECOME A LITTLE BIT TOO USED TO THE IDEA THAT A CITY IS SIMPLY SOMETHING APART FROM US THAT WE HAPPEN TO INHABIT AS OPPOSED TO BEING SOMETHING THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY PART OF AND GENERATING AND RECREATING IF YOU LIKE EVERY DAY AND THEREFORE YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT WE CITIZENS HAVE AN EFFECT ON AND TO SO TO TO WHATEVER EXTENTS AS POSSIBLE FOR FOR THAT SORT OF DATA GENERATION PLUS MAKING PUBLIC YOU KNOW WHATEVER EXTENTS IT'S POSSIBLE FOR THAT TO TO ACTUALLY LEAD TO A FEELING THAT WE ARE THE CITY WE ARE WE OWN THE CITY WE YOU KNOW THE CITY IS US THE BETTER SO I SUPPOSE THAT IS WHAT I WOULD LOOK FOR IN IF IF MY WISHES CAME TRUE
OKAY THAT THAT WAS BRILLIANT THAT WAS REALLY REALLY GOOD SO SO MY FINAL QUESTION IS REALLY A A A ? LEVEL QUESTION SO I LIKE MY COLLEAGUES IN THE BIG PROJECT ARE INTERVIEWING OTHER PEOPLE AND AND LOOKING OTHER RESOURCES TO CREATE OUR ROAD MAPS AND WHITE PAPERS SO EVEN NOW OR MAYBE LATER BY EMAIL I WAS WONDERING IF THERE ARE OTHER INDIVIDUALS OR ORGANIZATIONS THAT WE SHOULD ALSO BE SPEAKING TO AND IF THERE ARE ANY ONLINE RESOURCES THAT WE SHOULD MENTION THAT WE READ BEFORE WE CREATE OUR DOCUMENT
TWO PEOPLE SPRING TO MIND ONE IS DAN HILL I'M NOT SURE IF YOU'VE ALREADY SPOKEN TO HIM BUT HE IS THE CEO OF FABRICA HAS ALSO WORKED AT ? AND ? AND OTHER PLACES AND HE TALKS A LOT ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP OF THINGS LIKE DATA AND ALSO CREATIVE ? IN THE CONTEXT OF PUBLIC SECTOR ETC ETC SO HE WOULD BE ONE ? ? ? THE THE ARTIST ENGINEER WHO HAS WORKED A LOT WITH DATA AND INDICATORS SPECIALLY WITHIN THE THE THE CONTEXT OF THE URBAN ENVIRONMENT WOULD BE SOMEBODY ELSE BOTH OF THEM I CAN MAKE AN INTRODUCTION IF THAT'S USEFUL AND ONE OTHER PERSON WOULD BE ADAM GREENFIELD AUTHOR OF EVERYWARE THE DAWNING AGE OF THE UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING I THINK WAS THE SUBTITLE WHO WOULD ALSO HAVE INTERESTING THINGS TO SAY ON THIS AND AND AGAIN I CAN INTRODUCE YOU IF THAT'S USEFUL
OKAY THAT THAT'S GREAT SO MAYBE IF I DO A QUICK CHECK AND THEN I'LL ASK YOU FOR AN INTRODUCTION AS YOU WERE SO KIND TO DO THAT SO SO THAT'S THE END OF THE INTERVIEW USMAN I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU A LOT FOR THE USE OF YOUR VALUABLE TIME FOR GIVING IT UP FOR FOR US AND AS I SAY WE ? CLEAN THE INTERVIEW A LITTLE BIT ? THE STAT AND THEN I'LL EMAIL IT TO MY COLLEAGUES AND IT'LL COME UP ON THE BLOG AND I'LL AND I'LL LET YOU KNOW WHEN YOU CAN SEE IT SO THANKS A LOT FOR YOUR TIME IT'S VERY VERY MUCH APPRECIATED
MY PLEASURE EITHER EITHER FUN TIME AS WELL DO YEAH DO LET ME KNOW HOW GOES AND IF THERE'S ANYONE YOU'D LIKE TO BE CONNECTED TO HAVE A LOOK WHAT I'LL DO AS WELL I'LL EMAIL YOU THOSE NAMES SO YOU CAN GOOGLE THEM AND SEE WHAT IS SEEMS APPROPRIATE FOR YOUR FOR FOR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR OKAY
OKAY THANK YOU AND HAVE A GOOD AFTERNOON
